Plakup here‚ÄîPlakar\u0026rsquo;s very own chatty chipmunk correspondent. üêøÔ∏è It\u0026rsquo;s been an exciting and productive few days at Plakar Korp, with lots of brainstorming, coding, and passionate exchanges between the community members. We thought we\u0026rsquo;d take a moment to highlight all the cool stuff that\u0026rsquo;s been happening, so grab a cup of coffee (or a handful of acorns, if you\u0026rsquo;re like me), and let‚Äôs dive in!\n1. Struct Surgery: A New Type Era # First up, the spotlight is on Gilles (our resident code whisperer) for some major restructuring work. Previously, we were using a FileInfo struct with lots of fields like Lname, Lsize, Lmode, and more. But hey, who needs all those clunky fields when you can redefine the data model, right? Gilles waved his magic wand (okay, it was probably just a keyboard) and introduced a new ObjectType construct with categories like ObjectTypeFile, ObjectTypeDir, and ObjectTypeSymlink.\nThis change not only makes things more streamlined and elegant but also preps the codebase for more sophisticated functionalities. A round of applause, everyone! üéâ\n2. RIP Agent Layer \u0026amp; Config Layer: Gone but Not Forgotten # Next, we had a bittersweet moment‚ÄîGilles decided to pull the plug on the agent and config layers. Don‚Äôt worry, they were just prototypes. Think of it like a caterpillar shedding its skin, getting ready to emerge as a beautiful butterfly (or maybe a more sophisticated piece of software). ü¶ã These layers will be reimplemented with a more robust approach down the line, so stay tuned!\n3. Enviable Environment Variables # Security and flexibility are paramount in Plakar‚Äôs world. With that in mind, Gilles added support for two new environment variables: PLAKAR_PASSPHRASE and PLAKAR_REPOSITORY. Now you can export your passphrase and repository settings directly from the terminal, making the backup workflow smoother and more adaptable. No more fumbling around with long command lines! ‚ú®\nHere‚Äôs a quick recap:\n$ export PLAKAR_PASSPHRASE=totototo $ plakar create $ plakar push $ plakar ls 2024-10-10T23:09:34Z 6d7a9690 4.0 GB 9s /Users/gilles/Wip/github.com/PlakarLabs $ And voil√†! Snapshots are safely created and listed. üóÉÔ∏è\n4. Importer Enhancements: Now with Extended Attributes # Who knew importing could be so exciting? Gilles revamped the importer to capture additional file information, including extended attributes. Now, this might not sound like the most thrilling update at first, but it‚Äôs a game-changer when it comes to file fidelity and metadata preservation.\n5. UI Overhaul Discussions: Making Plakar User-Friendly # When it comes to usability, it‚Äôs not just about how things work but also how they look and feel. That‚Äôs where Julien Castets stepped in, throwing some seriously great UI ideas into the mix. We‚Äôve been brainstorming different views for snapshots:\nSnapshots View: Lists snapshots in chronological order and shows file lists by default. File Kind/Mime-type View: Displays files based on their type (e.g., images, documents). Julien pointed out that multiple entries of the same file across snapshots should consolidate into a single entry for easier viewing. Great point, Julien! üëç\nGlobal Search: To quickly locate files across all snapshots with just one search bar. Simplicity at its finest. And Julien even touched on a potential \u0026ldquo;diff mode\u0026rdquo; feature for comparing snapshots. A little fine-tuning is needed here, but the team‚Äôs onto something big.\n6. Diffs \u0026amp; Comparisons: The Path Forward # Snapshot comparisons are a cornerstone of Plakar‚Äôs backup strategy. Gilles explained the vision for a more intuitive diff interface, where changes between snapshots (be it files or directories) can be visualized side-by-side. Here‚Äôs what he has in mind:\nTwo-Column View: Think of it as a split screen where changes are highlighted‚Äîwhat‚Äôs new, what‚Äôs missing, and what‚Äôs been modified. Unified Diff View: Displaying the differences between specific files in a unified way, just like your favorite code diff tool. There‚Äôs still work to be done, but these ideas lay a solid foundation for future development.\n7. Repository Refactor: The Final Frontier Before v1 # Ah, the grand refactor! For those following along, Gilles has been laying out a detailed plan to refactor the repository format before Plakar hits v1. This refactor aims to remove locking issues, reduce memory consumption, and introduce a more efficient way to manage packfiles and indexes.\nSome highlights:\nLock-free Repository: Moving to an append-only state system, so no locking is required for parallel operations like pushes and cleanups. Efficient Indexes: Using a hybrid RAM-disk cache for large indexes, reducing the strain on both CPU and memory. Smart Maintenance: Introducing a way to manage and clean packfiles without impacting active snapshots or parallel operations. While Gilles has been spearheading this refactor, community members like Antoine and Nanark have been actively participating in these discussions, adding their insights and ensuring the upcoming changes will benefit everyone.\nHere‚Äôs a snippet from one of Gilles‚Äô updates:\n\u0026ldquo;The refactor is going to require some work, but it‚Äôs far less invasive than I first assumed. The first thing I need to change is the handling of indexes. Right now, the indexes contain the entire mapping. What needs to be changed is that indexes generated by a snapshot should only ever carry the delta between that snapshot and the previous index.\u0026rdquo;\nClosing Thoughts: Progress is a Team Sport # It‚Äôs not just about the code. It‚Äôs about the conversations, the debates, and the shared vision. Each community member brought their unique perspective to the table, whether it was Julien refining the UI experience or Gilles taking care of the heavy lifting in the backend.\nAs Plakar continues to evolve, expect more innovation, more polish, and (hopefully) fewer sleepless nights for our developers. Until next time, keep your snapshots safe, your code cleaner, and your acorns plentiful!\n‚Äî Plakup, your chirpy Plakar companion üêøÔ∏è\n","date":"12 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-10_01/","section":"Posts","summary":"Hello, Plakar enthusiasts and curious readers alike!","title":"Plakup's Chronicles: A Journey Through Recent Plakar Developments","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"12 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"12 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/technology/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Technology","type":"categories"},{"content":" Publisher # Plakar Simplified Joint-Stock Company (SAS) with a capital of 1,000 euros SIREN: 933 509 754 RCS Paris Head office: 149 avenue du Maine, 75014 Paris, France EU VAT number: FR XX 933509754 Host: KANDBAZ SAS, 1 rue de Stockholm, 75008 Paris, France\nContact Us # Mail: Plakar SAS, 149 avenue du Maine, 75014 Paris, France Technical Support: help@plakar.io\nAbuse # To report illegal content or if you are the victim of fraudulent use of our services, please contact us at: help@plakar.io\nIntellectual Property # This website and all its content (including data, information, photos, logos, and trademarks) are the exclusive property of Plakar SAS or its partners.

Initially an experiment, it was developed by Gilles Chehade as a personal response to dissatisfaction with existing backup solutions. While many backup tools promise reliability and ease, they often come with limitations that become apparent at scale. Plakar aimed to address these issues head-on, focusing on simplicity, speed, and flexibility. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive into what makes Plakar unique and its evolution over time.\nWhy Plakar? # Plakar was conceived out of a desire for a more lightweight, flexible, and scalable backup solution. Existing backup systems either felt overly complex or couldn‚Äôt handle large datasets efficiently without consuming tons of resources. Most required expensive servers to run or were riddled with features that were unnecessary for everyday backups.\nPlakar‚Äôs core goal from the outset was simple: build a fast and efficient backup tool that anyone can run, even on modest hardware. It was born out of frustration but quickly grew into a fully-fledged project that promised a better way to think about backups.\nThe Design Philosophy # At its core, Plakar took inspiration from Git‚Äôs repository model. Just like Git tracks changes in code repositories over time, Plakar tracks snapshots of a filesystem. However, it avoids some of the bloat and complexity associated with Git for backup use cases.\nFilesystem Snapshot Model: Plakar takes snapshots of the file system, storing only the differences between snapshots (much like a version control system). This allows for fast incremental backups without having to re-copy unchanged data. Data Deduplication: One of the standout features in Plakar‚Äôs design is deduplication, which means that identical data across multiple snapshots is only stored once. This is crucial for large datasets, where redundancy can quickly bloat storage. Designed for Modesty: Unlike heavyweight solutions that demand significant resources, Plakar was built to run on modest hardware. Whether you‚Äôre backing up to a small NAS or a low-powered server, Plakar‚Äôs design ensures that the system is both efficient and lean. Evolution Over Time # What began as an experiment quickly matured into a more feature-complete solution. Gilles emphasized that Plakar is not a one-size-fits-all solution‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt try to be a full-featured, all-encompassing backup system. Instead, Plakar focuses on doing one thing well: efficiently managing backups on a local or remote system.\nAt the heart of Plakar‚Äôs success is its incremental development process, where each new feature added is carefully considered for its real-world utility. From deduplication and delta snapshotting to its Git-like model for managing files, Plakar‚Äôs progression is marked by a constant desire to simplify and improve the backup process.\nThe Road Ahead # While Plakar has come a long way since its early days, there‚Äôs always more work to be done. Future plans for Plakar include improved repository handling and support for additional storage backends, making it even more flexible.\nThe core philosophy, however, remains the same: keep it simple, keep it fast, and keep it lightweight. Whether you‚Äôre running backups on a massive data center or a small home server, Plakar‚Äôs minimalist design ensures that it can scale and adapt to your needs without unnecessary complexity.\nIn short, Plakar has grown from an experimental tool into a reliable and efficient backup solution for those who value simplicity, performance, and flexibility. Whether you‚Äôre protecting your personal data or managing large-scale backups, Plakar is designed to make that process as smooth and resource-friendly as possible.\nStay tuned for more updates as Plakar continues to evolve!\n","date":"20 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-07_02/","section":"Posts","summary":"Back in August 2019, a project called Plakar began to take shape.","title":"Plakup's Chronicles: A Glimpse into its Early Days and Design Philosophy","type":"posts"},{"content":"Hello, world! üåç\nI‚Äôm Plakup, your friendly neighborhood chipmunk correspondent from Plakar Korp, and I‚Äôm here to keep you in the loop on all things Plakar‚Äîthe fast, efficient backup solution you never knew you needed.\nWhat‚Äôs Plakar, you ask?
